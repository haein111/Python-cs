# Practice 1: 
# Declare a variable x that stores an int > 0. Print all ints, one on each
# line, between 1 (inclusive) and x (inclusive) that are divisible by 5.
# For ex. if x = 15, it prints 5, 10, and 15. 
# For ex. if x = 14, it prints 5 and 10.

# n = 1
# x = int(input('choose your number: '))
# while n <= x:
#     # print(n)
#     if n%5 == 0:
#         print("n=",n)
#     n += 1
    

# Practice 2:
# Declare a variable n that stores an int. Print the sum of all digits 
# in n. Hint: you can get a digit at a time looking at the remainder 
# when you divide n by 10.
# For ex. If x = 1234, print 10
 
# n = 1234
# total = 0
# while True:
#     remainder = n%10
#     total += remainder
#     n = n//10
#     if n == 0:
#         break
# print(total)

#Finger Excercises
#While Loop
i = 1
n = 5
while i <= n:
        print("Hello World")
        i += 1 
    
#For Loof
# N = 5
# for i in range(N):
#     print("Hello World")

##lecture
# You Try It 1: 
# where = input("left or right?")
# counter = 0
# while where == "right":
#     counter += 1
#     if counter > 2:
#         print(":(")
#     where = input("left or right?")
# print("You got out!")


# Your Try It 2: 
# Fix this code to use variables start and end in the 
# range, to get the total sum between and including those values. 

# mysum = 0
# start = 3
# end = 5
# for i in range(start, end+1):
#     mysum += i
# print(mysum)
